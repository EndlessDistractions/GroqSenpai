GroqSenpai is a prototype ai compainion discord bot backed by Groq ai api

to get started first you need to make setup.sh executable
>>> cd /path/to/your/script
>>> chmod +x setup.sh
then you need to execute the script
>>> ./setup.sh
this will create an environment that has the dependencies needed for the program to run
aswell as create a few missing files that are nessicary but are excluded for privacy and security reasons.


next you will need to get a discord bot token and a Grok api key and add them to newly created .env file
